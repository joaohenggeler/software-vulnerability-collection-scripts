# Software Vulnerability Collection Scripts

A collection of scripts used for scraping vulnerability metadata from [CVE Details](https://www.cvedetails.com/), retrieving any affected files from each project's version control system, generating software metrics and security alerts using Static Analysis Tools (SATs), storing the collected information in a database, and creating machine learning models capable of identifying vulnerable C/C++ code.

The repository is organized as follows:

* `Scripts/*.py`: the scripts that perform each of the aforementioned tasks.

* `Scripts/propheticus/instances/vulnerability_prediction_final/*.py`: the scripts required by the [Propheticus](http://www.joaorcampos.com/ISSRE-2019/) tool in order to create machine learning models.

* `Scripts/modules/*.py`: general purpose modules used to scrape vulnerability metadata and to interface with the database and each project's version control system.

* `Scripts/modules/config/*.json`: the configuration files used to change the behavior of the previous scripts.

* `Scripts/modules/data`: static data files referenced by some scripts (e.g. a file mapping each Cppcheck security alert to a CWE), the SQL scripts used to export the raw code unit datasets from the database, and a collection of patches used to change the behavior of third-party scripts like the Propheticus tool.
